# Py Me Up, Charlie
## Challenge Instructions
This project utilizes Python to create one script for analyzing the financial records of a company (PyBank) and another script for analyzing the votes from an election (PyPoll).

## PyBank
![Financial Analysis](https://www.carolineuniversity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Financial-Analysis.jpg)
The set of financial data is called [budget_data.csv](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/python-challenge/blob/master/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv), which is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`.
- Create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

</p>

- In addition, the final script both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results

## PyPoll
![Poll Analysis](https://labourlist.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/poll_vote-1600x900.jpg)
The set of poll data is called [election_data.csv](https://github.com/Jiuhe2020/python-challenge/blob/master/PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv), which is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.
- Create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
  - The total number of votes cast
  - A complete list of candidates who received votes
  - The percentage of votes each candidate won
  - The total number of votes each candidate won
  - The winner of the election based on popular vote

- In addition, the final script both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results
